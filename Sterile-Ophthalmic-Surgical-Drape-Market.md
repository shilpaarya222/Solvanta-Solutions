Among product types, the single-use sterile ophthalmic drapes dominate the market due to their convenience and cost-effectiveness, reducing the risk of infection during surgeries. The rise in outpatient procedures and advancements in healthcare infrastructure in emerging economies are also contributing to the market’s growth. In terms of end-users, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) are the largest consumers of sterile ophthalmic drapes.
