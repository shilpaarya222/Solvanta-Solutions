Moreover, the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies has bolstered the development of immersive Meta Universe environments, further driving demand for blockchain-based games. In addition, with the increasing interest in digital ownership and the integration of NFTs into gaming, developers are looking to create more seamless and engaging experiences where players can buy, sell, and trade virtual items securely.
